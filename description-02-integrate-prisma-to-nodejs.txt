video 50 - integrate prisma into nodejs 

npm i prisma-binding@2.1.1

create prisma.js 
import { Prisma } from 'prisma-binding';

const prisma = new Prisma({
    typeDefs: '',
    endpoint: 'http://localhost:4466',
})

endpoint: http://localhost:4466

for typeDefs : it is complex, for this we need to introduce tool for that(npm module)
it is common mistake to try to use the prisma datamodel.graphql file for value for typeDefs

the tool is graphql-cli

npm i graphql-cli@2.16.4
which have get-schema command(option)

once done we will create one file called ".graphqlconfig" and set-up the script in pacakge.json  

for file ".graphqlconfig" we need to tell visual studio code that, this file should be tretead as json when it comes to 
syntax higlighting and formating

open command palate
>Change language mode -> select JSON and not JSON(not json with comment).
create generated folder inside src folder

{
    "projects": {
        "prisma": {
            "schemaPath": "src/generated/prisma.graphql",
            "extensions": {
                "endpoints": {
                    "default": "http://localhost:4466"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

and in prisma.js 
import { Prisma } from 'prisma-binding';

const prisma = new Prisma({
    typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
    endpoint: 'localhost:4466',
})

now add 
script in pacakge.json

"get-schema":"graphql get-schema -p prisma"
-p is for project name and it's value is project name which we have added in ".graphqlconfig" 
for ex 
 
{  
    "projects": {
        "prisma": {}
    }
}
