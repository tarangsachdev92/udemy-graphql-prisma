create postgress server(db) form heroku 
install pgadmin
configure heroku postgress db in pgAdmin 
install docker commuinity edition for mac
run docker

now go to prisma.io

prisma.io
prisma.io/docs/

prisma init prisma(any name) (it is not working for 1.12.0 so we install npm i -g prisma@1.34.10 )

two option will appear on above command

1. Use existing database      Connect to existing database - select that option because we alreday have created that
2. Create new database       Set up a local database using Docker 

after that 

? What kind of database do you want to deploy to? (Use arrow keys)
 MySQL             MySQL compliant databases like MySQL or MariaDB 
❯ PostgreSQL        PostgreSQL database 

  we will select postgresSQL

3 question 
Does your database contain existing data? (Use arrow keys)
  No 
❯ Yes (experimental - Prisma migrations not yet supported) 

we give Yes

now next question is about connection 
? Enter database host (localhost) -> ec2-34-230-231-71.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Enter database port 5432

? Enter database user -> mfslwgrhrutdmn
? Enter database password -> 30ee3a412c292054c394718fcb04d38ba2ddec6be7c844c567560acbab2dbc4d
? Enter database name -> da0vl4eb8o3jn6
? Use SSL? (Y/n) -> Y

// based on the version of prisma we have one question 
? select the programming language for the generated prisma client
 Prisma Typescript Client 
 Prisma Flow Client 
 Prisma Javascript Client 
 Prisma Go Client 
 > Don't Generate -> select that

select Don't generated 

? Enter name of existing schema -> schema.graphql (not asked in latest version so ok if you don't see it 
                                                   and if you see it give name of the schema for ex -> schema.graphql )

it created 3 files in prisma folder and also give the steps to actully things sets up

1.datamodel.graphql -> same as schema.graphql - prisma uses this to determine our db structure ->
 so graphql type definition end up changing the strcuture of our db looks like

2.docker-compose.yml -> this file will startup the docker container

there is a property -> "schema: schema.graphql" -> we need to remove that and add new property "ssl: true"

3.prisma.yml -> 

to deploy 
steps 
1. Open folder: cd prisma
2. Start your Prisma server: docker-compose up -d
3. Deploy your Prisma service: prisma deploy

==== then go to http://localhost:4466/ ====  => grpahql playgorund
